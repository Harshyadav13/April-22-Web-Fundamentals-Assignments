          CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
          including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve
          content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
          specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web
          pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
          .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural
          content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page
          load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
